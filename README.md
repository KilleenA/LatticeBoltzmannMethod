# LatticeBoltzmannMethod
A lattice-Boltzmann method for a confluent growing tissue, implemented in C++. For a full description of the implementation please see Ref. [1]. This code was developed in conjunction with Benjamin Partridge, who is also a coauthor on the paper.

The model can be run using D2Q7 or D2Q9 lattice and initialised in a rectangular or circular geometry. It currently saves the position of the tissue boundary, along with the mass density of tissue at each site
